# Higher-Level Programming & Algorithm

This repository features my solutions to the activities assigned during the Higher-level Programming & Algorithm projects, 
as part of the Full Stack Software Engineering program organized by ALX Africa. The program ran from June 2022 and will end in July 2023,
and I was part of the cohort08. The projects were written primarily in Python, but also involved the implementation of other programming languages such as C, JavaScript, and shell. As a result, the projects have helped me to develop a diverse range of skills and knowledge 
in software engineering and programming.
