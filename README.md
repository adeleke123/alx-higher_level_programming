# Higeher-level programming & Algorithm

This repository contains solution programs written for the Higher-level programming & Algorithm projects/tasks.
This is part of the Full Stack Software Engineer program organized by Alx Africa which occurred throughout the duration of the year 2022 June, cohort08 curriculum.
 The projects are written in py programming language.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to install the following tools.
### Python Scripts

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
-   A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of *this* project, is mandatory
-   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### Shell Scripts

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
-   All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
-   All your files must be executable

### C Scripts

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl") and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
-   You are not allowed to use global variables
-   No more than 5 functions per file
-   In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repo (if you do we won't take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
-   The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
-   Don't forget to push your header file
-   All your header files should be include guarded
